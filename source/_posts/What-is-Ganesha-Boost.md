#  What is Ganesha Boost?

Ganesha Boost is the latest creativity app for Apple devices that has been designed to help users boost their creative thinking. The app has been built around the concept of gamification, which is the application of game mechanics and design principles to non-game contexts. Gamification can be used to motivate people to learn new things or complete tasks.

Ganesha Boost consists of a series of puzzles that require users to think creatively in order to solve them. The puzzles are based on classic problems from fields such as mathematics, physics, and engineering. Each puzzle is accompanied by a video lesson in which the solution is explained.

The app is available for free on the App Store. It was developed by Jishnu Bhattacharya, an Indian software engineer and entrepreneur.

#  What is the game about?

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where you are a survivor trying to rebuild society. You will start with nothing but your wits and must scavenge the land for food, weapons, and other resources to help you survive. The game features both base-building and combat, so you will need to be careful when expanding your territory. Bandits and other survivors may try to take what you have worked hard to build, so be prepared to defend your holdings!

# What are the key features?

#  Where can I find it?

Finding the right place to start your research can be daunting. One great way to begin narrowing down your search is by finding out where others have found great information. You can ask classmates, colleagues, and friends where they go to find reliable sources on the internet.

Some resources that you may want to consider are Google Scholar, a free academic search engine, and Credo Reference, a database of encyclopedias and other reference materials.

If you are looking for articles on a specific topic, Google Scholar can be a great place to start. Simply type in your topic and hit "enter." Google Scholar will provide you with a list of relevant scholarly articles from different sources.

Credo Reference is another great resource for finding scholarly articles. You can search for articles by title, author, or subject matter. The database also includes citations and abstracts from journal articles and book chapters.

Another great way to find reliable sources is by using library databases. Your local library likely has a subscription to several databases, such as JSTOR and EBSCOhost. These databases contain thousands of journals, magazine articles, and primary source documents that you can access from home.
