This news comes just a few months after the company closed its doors on all of its bingo halls back in November of 2018. Hoffman Gaming is hoping to have the new facilities up and running by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The announcement was made via the company’s website, where they stated that they were excited to be reopening their bingo halls and offer their players the same level of service that they have always provided. They also mentioned that they were committed to helping revive the bingo industry in New Jersey.</p>
<p>In order to help make this happen, Hoffman Gaming has announced that it will be partnering with two local lottery operators in the state. These operators are GTECH Holdings and IGT Americas. Both companies are extremely experienced in the world of gaming and will be able to help Hoffman Gaming get their new bingo halls off the ground.</p>
<p>The company has not released any details about where these new bingo halls will be located or how many there will be. However, they have said that more information will be released closer to the reopening date. This has left many people wondering if there is going to be a Hoffman Gaming Bingo hall near them.</p>
<p>The closure of Hoffman’s bingo halls last year created a lot of chaos in the industry. Many players were left without a place to play and many employees lost their jobs. It will be great to see these halls reopened and providing much-needed jobs in the state.</p>

Now, it seems that the popular bingo commentator is making a return!</p>
<p>Hoffman first made his name as a commentator on the now defunct DoubleDown Casino. Since then, he has become one of the most well-known names in NJ-New Jersey bingo. In addition to his commentary, Hoffman is also known for his popular “Bingo Lingo” show.</p>
<p>While Hoffman has not given any indication of what led to his change of heart, many fans are undoubtedly excited to see him back in action. In a post on his Facebook page, Hoffman said that he is “excited to be back and bring some fun new games to the mix!”</p>
<p>While it is unclear what new games Hoffman has planned, we can be sure that they will be entertaining and engaging. Fans can expect Hoffman’s trademark humor and insight to make an appearance as well!</p>
<h1 id="Hoffman-reopening-their-NJ-New-Jersey-Bingo-Halls-soon"><a href="#Hoffman-reopening-their-NJ-New-Jersey-Bingo-Halls-soon" class="headerlink" title="Hoffman reopening their NJ-New Jersey Bingo Halls soon!"></a>Hoffman reopening their NJ-New Jersey Bingo Halls soon!</h1><p>Atlantic City, NJ – Hoffman Gaming announced that they will be reopening their three bingo halls in New Jersey this summer. The halls, which closed in 2009, are located in Pleasantville, Atlantic City and Linden.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to reopen our bingo halls in New Jersey and bring back the excitement and fun that players have come to know and love,” said Hoffman Gaming CEO Alan Silver.</p>
<p>The reopening of the Hoffman bingo halls will create over 100 new jobs in the area. In addition to providing employment opportunities, the reopened halls will also generate significant economic activity for local businesses.</p>
<p>“We cannot wait to get started and we know that our players are just as excited as we are,” added Silver.</p>
<p>The Hoffman bingo halls will offer a variety of different games including traditional paper bingo, electronic bingo and pull tabs. There will also be a variety of promotions and giveaways available to players.</p>
<h1 id="Plans-for-Hoffman’s-reopening-of-their-NJ-New-Jersey-Bingo-Halls"><a href="#Plans-for-Hoffman’s-reopening-of-their-NJ-New-Jersey-Bingo-Halls" class="headerlink" title="Plans for Hoffman’s reopening of their NJ-New Jersey Bingo Halls!"></a>Plans for Hoffman’s reopening of their NJ-New Jersey Bingo Halls!</h1><p>Hoffman’s Corporation, a bingo hall and casino operator with locations in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, just announced they will be reopening their two shuttered New Jersey bingo halls. The two halls, located in Garfield and Newark, will reopen on September 1st after being closed for over two years.</p>
<p>The decision to reopen the halls was made after an extensive study of the market which showed that there is still a demand for bingo in the state. The Garfield location has been completely renovated and will offer players over $1 million in prizes each month. The Newark location will also offer significant prize money, but will have a more limited schedule.</p>
<p>Both locations will offer electronic bingo as well as traditional paper cards. There will also be a variety of other activities available, including restaurants, bars, and lounges. Hoffman’s plans to hire up to 100 people for each hall.</p>
<p>This is great news for New Jersey bingo players, who have been without a place to play since the closure of the two halls. It’s also good news for Hoffman’s, which is looking to increase its market share in New Jersey.</p>

The photo was captioned “Back in the saddle again.”</p>
<p>Since returning to the scene, Hoffman has been playing frequently and making appearances at different halls throughout the state. His return has generated a great deal of excitement among New Jersey bingo players, who have eagerly been awaiting his return.</p>
<p>Hoffman is one of the most successful and well-known bingo players in the world. He has won numerous major tournaments over the years and is considered to be one of the best players in the game.</p>
<p>Prior to his hiatus from the NJ-New Jersey bingo scene, Hoffman was a regular at many of the state’s halls, often playing multiple sessions per day. He is known for his aggressive playing style and his propensity for winning large pots.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Hoffman fares upon his return to New Jersey bingo. He is sure to face stiff competition from some of the top players in the state, but it’s safe to say that he will be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
