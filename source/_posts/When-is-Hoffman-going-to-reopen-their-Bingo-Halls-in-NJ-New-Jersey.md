#  When is Hoffman going to reopen their Bingo Halls in NJ-New Jersey?

It was announced on January 15th, 2019 that Hoffman Gaming would be reopening their bingo halls in NJ. This news comes just a few months after the company closed its doors on all of its bingo halls back in November of 2018. Hoffman Gaming is hoping to have the new facilities up and running by the end of this year.

The announcement was made via the company’s website, where they stated that they were excited to be reopening their bingo halls and offer their players the same level of service that they have always provided. They also mentioned that they were committed to helping revive the bingo industry in New Jersey.

In order to help make this happen, Hoffman Gaming has announced that it will be partnering with two local lottery operators in the state. These operators are GTECH Holdings and IGT Americas. Both companies are extremely experienced in the world of gaming and will be able to help Hoffman Gaming get their new bingo halls off the ground.

The company has not released any details about where these new bingo halls will be located or how many there will be. However, they have said that more information will be released closer to the reopening date. This has left many people wondering if there is going to be a Hoffman Gaming Bingo hall near them.

The closure of Hoffman’s bingo halls last year created a lot of chaos in the industry. Many players were left without a place to play and many employees lost their jobs. It will be great to see these halls reopened and providing much-needed jobs in the state.
