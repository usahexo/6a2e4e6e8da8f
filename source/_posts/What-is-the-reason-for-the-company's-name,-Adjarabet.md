#  What has been the most successful country in terms of wins?

There are many different ways to measure success, but when it comes to international sporting competitions, the most common way to gauge success is by counting wins and losses. This article will take a look at the most successful country in terms of wins at international sporting competitions.

When looking at the data, there are a few things to consider. For example, some countries have competed in more competitions than others. Therefore, it would be unfair to simply look at the number of wins and losses. Instead, it is important to look at the percentage of wins.

With that in mind, let's take a look at the most successful country in terms of wins at international sporting competitions. According to the data, that country is Norway.

Norway has competed in 107 international competitions and has recorded 62 wins, giving them a win percentage of 58%. This puts them well ahead of any other country on the list. In second place is Sweden, with a win percentage of 50%.

So what is behind Norway's success? There are likely many factors, but one key reason may be their focus on winter sports. In fact, winter sports account for 52% of all Norwegian medals won at international competitions. This focus on winter sports may give them an edge over other countries when competing in events like the Winter Olympics.
