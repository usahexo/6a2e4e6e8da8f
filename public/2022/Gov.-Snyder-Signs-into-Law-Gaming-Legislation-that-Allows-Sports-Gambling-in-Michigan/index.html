Snyder Signs into Law Gaming Legislation that Allows Sports Gambling in Michigan"></a>Gov. Snyder Signs into Law Gaming Legislation that Allows Sports Gambling in Michigan</h1><p>Gov. Rick Snyder on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2017, signed legislation allowing sports gambling in Michigan _ a move that could pave the way for the state to legalize online sports betting.</p>
<p>The governor’s signature comes after the Republican-controlled Legislature voted last week to OK bills regulating and taxing sports betting at casinos and horse tracks.</p>
<p>“This new legislation will allow Michigan casinos to offer innovative gaming products while protecting citizens and generating new revenue for our state,” Snyder said in a news release.</p>
<p>Casinos and race tracks can now apply for a license to offer sports betting, which is expected to bring in $16 million annually in taxes. The money will go toward road repairs and gambling addiction programs. The state also will get 5 percent of the total amount wagered on professional and collegiate games.</p>
<p>The move by Michigan comes as other states, including New Jersey, are moving to legalize sports gambling following a U.S. Supreme Court decision in May that overturned a federal law banning it in most states.</p>
<p>Michigan’s new law prohibits people under 21 from placing bets, bans wagering on university sporting events and requires casinos and race tracks to use official data from sporting leagues to settle bets. It also allows live betting at casinos and on mobile devices.</p>
<h1 id="State-of-Michigan-to-Start-Collecting-Revenue-from-Sports-Betting-within-Weeks"><a href="#State-of-Michigan-to-Start-Collecting-Revenue-from-Sports-Betting-within-Weeks" class="headerlink" title="State of Michigan to Start Collecting Revenue from Sports Betting within Weeks"></a>State of Michigan to Start Collecting Revenue from Sports Betting within Weeks</h1><p>Michigan is on the cusp of starting to collect revenue from sports betting, with lawmakers saying they expect it to begin within weeks.</p>
<p>The state has already authorized sports betting, and now it’s just a matter of finalizing the regulations and getting the infrastructure in place. The hope is that this will bring in some much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats, though. First, the state is only allowing sports betting at land-based casinos. This could be a disadvantage for Michigan, since other states are allowing online sports betting.</p>
<p>Another issue is that it’s not clear how much money the state will actually be able to bring in from sports betting. There’s a lot of competition out there, and Michigan is up against well-established markets like New Jersey and Nevada.</p>
<p>Still, there’s potential for Michigan to make some good money off of sports betting. The important thing now is to finalize the regulations and get things up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
<h1 id="First-Casino-in-Detroit-to-Offer-Sports-Wagering-Starting-Tomorrow"><a href="#First-Casino-in-Detroit-to-Offer-Sports-Wagering-Starting-Tomorrow" class="headerlink" title="First Casino in Detroit to Offer Sports Wagering Starting Tomorrow"></a>First Casino in Detroit to Offer Sports Wagering Starting Tomorrow</h1><p>The first casino in Detroit to offer sports betting is MGM Grand Detroit. The casino announced this week that they will start taking sports bets starting tomorrow, November 14th.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit is one of three casinos in the city of Detroit, and it is the only one that will be offering sports betting initially. The other two casinos, MotorCity Casino and Greektown Casino, have not yet announced when they will begin offering sports betting.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit has been in the process of setting up its sports wagering operation for several months. The casino has partnered with the popular gaming company William Hill to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways that people can bet on sports at MGM Grand Detroit. They can place a wager on the outcome of a game or on how many points a team will win by. They can also bet on how many points a team will lose by, or whether there will be over or under a certain number of points scored in a game.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional bets, MGM Grand Detroit will also be offering some more creative bets. For example, they will allow people to bet on things like who will score the first touchdown in a game, or what the margin of victory will be.</p>
<p>MGM Grand Detroit says that it plans to offer both pre-match and in-play betting. This means that people will be able to place bets even after the game has started.</p>
<p>The launch of sports betting at MGM Grand Detroit comes at a time when interest in gambling is high in Michigan. A recent study showed that around 12% of Michigan residents participate in some form of gambling each year. This is higher than the national average of 9%.</p>
<h1 id="Michigan-Casinos-Poised-to-cash-in-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Michigan-Casinos-Poised-to-cash-in-on-Newly-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Michigan Casinos Poised to cash in on Newly Legalized Sports Betting"></a>Michigan Casinos Poised to cash in on Newly Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>Michigan casinos are preparing to cash in on the newly legalized sports betting, as lawmakers struggle to finalize the regulations that will govern the industry.</p>
<p>The state’s three dozen tribal and commercial casinos could potentially offer bets on professional and college sports as soon as this year, according to the Detroit Free Press. Michigan is among a handful of states where legislators are rushing to legalize sports betting in order to take advantage of a recent Supreme Court ruling overturning a federal ban on the activity.</p>
<p>In anticipation of strong demand, casino operators are already investing in infrastructure and hiring staff for their sports books. The new industry is also expected to create jobs for Michigan residents, with one study predicting that it could generate more than 1,500 positions.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos in Michigan have been permitted to offer limited forms of gambling since 1996, when voters approved a referendum authorizing gaming on Native American reservations. The state’s commercial casinos opened in 2007.</p>
<p>Sports betting was outlawed by Congress in 1992, but the Supreme Court ruling last year opened the door for states to legalize the activity if they choose. So far, 10 states have moved to approve some form of sports gambling, including Michigan’s neighbor Indiana.</p>
<p>Under current proposals in Michigan, bettors would be able to wager on games at physical casinos, online, or through mobile apps. The state lottery would also be authorized to offer sports betting. Legislators are still debating how much tax revenue to collect from the industry and what other regulations should be put in place.</p>
<p>Casino owners say they’re eager to get started but want assurances that the state will take a “reasonable and responsible approach” to regulating the new industry. “We need clarity from Lansing on what is allowed and what isn’t and ensure that there is an equitable sharing of taxes between the state and our operators,” said Mike Bowers, president and CEO of MGM Grand Detroit Casino Resort.</p>
<h1 id="Gov-Snyder-This-is-about-creating-jobs-and-bringing-more-revenue-to-our-state"><a href="#Gov-Snyder-This-is-about-creating-jobs-and-bringing-more-revenue-to-our-state" class="headerlink" title="Gov. Snyder: This is about creating jobs and bringing more revenue to our state"></a>Gov. Snyder: This is about creating jobs and bringing more revenue to our state</h1><p>Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder announced Wednesday a proposal to tax the use of software in the state, with the goal of generating an additional $61 million in revenue for Michigan and create jobs.</p>
<p>“This is about creating jobs and bringing more revenue to our state,” Snyder said in a statement. “The targeted software tax would spur growth in Michigan’s information technology sector by encouraging businesses to invest in our state.”</p>
<p>Snyder’s proposed 7 percent tax would be levied on “the sale of or use of software intended for business purposes in Michigan,” according to a statement from his office. The governor is expected to outline the proposal during his annual State of the State address next week.</p>
<p>The move would make Michigan one of just a handful of states that taxes software, alongside Texas, New York and California. Several other states are considering similar proposals.</p>
<p>Supporters say the tax would help level the playing field for Michigan-based software companies competing against out-of-state rivals that don’t have to pay such a tax. They also argue it would generate new investment in the state’s tech sector and create jobs.</p>
<p>Opponents argue that the tax would penalize businesses for buying needed software and could lead to higher prices for consumers. They also say it could hurt Michigan’s competitiveness and discourage businesses from locating or expanding here.</p>
