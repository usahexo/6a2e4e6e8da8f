#  Royal Panda Introduces Exciting New Sports Betting Lineup 

On February 26, 2019, Royal Panda announced the launch of its new sports betting lineup. Included in this expansion are a variety of new markets, including eSports and political betting.

The move comes as the gambling company looks to capitalize on the growing popularity of sports betting, particularly in light of the recent repeal of the United Kingdom's Wire Act. This has allowed for a broader range of sports betting options to be offered to British consumers.

Royal Panda is not alone in its quest to capitalize on this trend; other gambling companies are also expanding their sports betting offerings. For example, Bet365 recently announced that it would be adding coverage of North American eSports tournaments to its lineup.

As part of its expansion, Royal Panda is also offering a new welcome bonus for its sports betting customers. This bonus consists of a matched deposit offer, up to £100. In addition, there are weekly casino bonuses available, as well as a loyalty program that rewards customers with points for each bet they make.

The company has stated that it plans to continue expanding its sports betting lineup in the future, with the aim of making it the most comprehensive and user-friendly option available online.

#  Royal Panda Sports Betting Goes Mobile 

Royal Panda, one of the world’s most popular online casino and sports betting operators, is going mobile. The company announced this week that it has released a new mobile app that will allow players to bet on the go.

The new Royal Panda Sports app is available now on iOS and Android devices. It offers a wide range of betting options, including pre-match and in-play betting on football, tennis, basketball, golf, and many other sports. Players can also bet on major events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games.

The Royal Panda Sports app also offers live streaming of sporting events, allowing players to watch the action as they bet. This is a great feature for those who like to follow the games closely while making bets.

The Royal Panda Sports app is easy to use and provides a great betting experience on the go. Players can easily find the odds they are looking for, place bets quickly and easily, and keep track of their bets and winnings. The app also features a helpful FAQ section that provides answers to common questions about sports betting.

Royal Panda is one of the world’s most popular online casinos and sports books, with a large following of satisfied customers. The company has a strong commitment to providing excellent customer service and great gaming experiences. With its new mobile app, Royal Panda is bringing its great services to players around the world who want to bet on the go.

#  Royal Panda Adds Horse Racing to its Sports Betting Offerings 

This week, Royal Panda announced that it is expanding its sports betting offerings to include horse racing. This addition comes as the online gambling operator looks to increase its market share in what is becoming an increasingly competitive marketplace.

Royal Panda offers a wide range of sports for punters to bet on, including football, tennis, and basketball. The addition of horse racing to this list gives customers even more options when choosing what to put their money on. And with horse racing offering some of the most lucrative odds in the sporting world, there’s plenty of potential for big payouts.

To coincide with the launch of horse racing, Royal Panda has also introduced a new welcome bonus offer. New customers can now receive a 100% match bonus on their first deposit, up to €100. This means that you could potentially double your money just by signing up and making a small wager on one of the races.

Royal Panda is an award-winning online casino and sports betting operator that was launched in 2014. It is licensed and regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority and the Gambling Commission of Great Britain. The site offers a wide range of slots, table games, and sports betting options, as well as 24/7 customer support.

#  Royal Panda Expands its Sports Betting Coverage to Include More Markets 

Online gambling operator Royal Panda has announced that it is expanding its sports betting coverage to include more markets. The company has revealed that it will now offer odds on events from around the world, including the United States, Asia, and Europe. 

Royal Panda’s Head of Sports Betting, Peter Ostrouchov, said that the decision to expand its sports betting offering was in response to growing customer demand. He also added that the company is committed to providing its customers with a high-quality betting experience. 

The move comes as Royal Panda looks to build on its recent successes in the online gambling market. The company has seen strong growth in recent years, with revenue up by over 50% in 2017. This has been largely attributed to the operator’s successful expansion into new markets, as well as its focus on providing a high-quality customer experience. 

Royal Panda’s sports betting offering currently includes odds on a wide range of events, including football, tennis, basketball, and American football. The company is also one of a select few operators licensed to offer bets on eSports matches. 

Customers can access Royal Panda’s sports betting coverage via the company’s website or mobile app.
