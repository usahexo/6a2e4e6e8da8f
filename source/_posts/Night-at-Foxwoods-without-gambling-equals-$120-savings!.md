#  Night at Foxwoods without gambling equals $120 savings!

This past Saturday night, my boyfriend and I were looking for something to do and didn't want to spend a lot of money. We heard that Foxwoods Resort Casino had a free concert that night with Boyz II Men and wanted to check it out. We usually gamble when we go to Foxwoods, but this time we left our wallets in the car and had a great time!

If you're looking for things to do at Foxwoods Resort Casino without gambling, here are some options:

-Head over to the Grand Theater for a show. Upcoming shows include Steve Martin, Il Divo, and Jerry Seinfeld.

-Check out one of the restaurants like Nathan's or Michael Jordan's Steakhouse. You can also find buffets, food courts, and pizza places if you're looking for something less expensive.

-Play some of the arcade games or try your luck at the slots. There are also several shops where you can spend money.

-Take a walk around the property and enjoy the views.

We walked around for awhile and then decided to see the show in the Grand Theater. We each only spent $10 on parking which was much cheaper than what we would have spent if we had gambled! The show was really good and it was great to see an iconic group like Boyz II Men live. We had such a great time that we didn't even mind that we didn't gamble!

If you're looking for something fun to do without spending a lot of money, I recommend checking out Foxwoods Resort Casino. You can find shows, restaurants, and other activities without having to gamble!
