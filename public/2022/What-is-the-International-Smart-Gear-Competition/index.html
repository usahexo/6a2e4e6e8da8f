<h1 id="Why-was-it-created"><a href="#Why-was-it-created" class="headerlink" title="Why was it created?"></a>Why was it created?</h1><p>The Markdown markup language was created in 2004 by John Gruber with the goal of providing a simple way to format text for the web.</p>
<p>Gruber was inspired by the work of early bloggers who were looking for an easy way to format their posts without relying on HTML, which was more complex and challenging to learn.</p>
<p>Markdown provided a simplified syntax that could be easily understood and used by writers without any prior coding experience.</p>
<h1 id="How-is-it-used"><a href="#How-is-it-used" class="headerlink" title="How is it used?"></a>How is it used?</h1><p>Markdown can be used to create basic text formatting, such as headings, bold and italic text, lists, and links.</p>
<p>It can also be used to create more complex structures, such as tables and blockquotes.</p>
<p>To use Markdown, you simply type the desired formatting into your document and it will automatically be converted into HTML when you publish or export your file.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-its-benefits"><a href="#What-are-its-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What are its benefits?"></a>What are its benefits?</h1><p>Markdown has several benefits over traditional HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is easier to learn and use than HTML. - It provides a simpler way to format text for the web. - It automatically converts to HTML when published or exported, so there is no need to learn or use additional software. - It can be used with a wide range of publishing platforms and software applications.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-participating"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-participating" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of participating?"></a>What are the benefits of participating?</h1><p>There are many benefits to participating in community service. One of the most important is that it gives people a sense of purpose and feeling of connectedness. It can also help people learn new skills, make new friends, and get to know their community better. Additionally, community service can help people develop a stronger sense of identity and self-worth. Finally, it can also be a way to give back to the community</p>
<h1 id="How-many-countries-are-involved"><a href="#How-many-countries-are-involved" class="headerlink" title="How many countries are involved?"></a>How many countries are involved?</h1><p>In total, there are 193 UN member states. This includes the 193 member states of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>There are also two observer states: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine.</p>
<p>There are six member states of the United Nations that are not members of the UN General Assembly: Kosovo, Niue, the Cook Islands, Taiwan, Tokelau, and Vatican City.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-deadline-for-submission"><a href="#What-is-the-deadline-for-submission" class="headerlink" title="What is the deadline for submission?"></a>What is the deadline for submission?</h1><p>The deadline for submission varies depending on the journal, but is typically several months before the release of the issue. For example, The Lancet has a deadline of September 1 for submissions to be considered for its October issue.</p>
<h1 id="What-types-of-articles-are-accepted"><a href="#What-types-of-articles-are-accepted" class="headerlink" title="What types of articles are accepted?"></a>What types of articles are accepted?</h1><p>There is no one type of article that is universally accepted by all journals. However, most journals accept original research articles, reviews, and editorials.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-average-length-of-an-article"><a href="#What-is-the-average-length-of-an-article" class="headerlink" title="What is the average length of an article?"></a>What is the average length of an article?</h1><p>The average length of an article can vary significantly depending on the type of article and the journal it is being submitted to. However, most original research articles tend to be around 5,000 words in length, while reviews and editorials are typically shorter in length.</p>
<h1 id="How-should-I-structure-my-article"><a href="#How-should-I-structure-my-article" class="headerlink" title="How should I structure my article?"></a>How should I structure my article?</h1><p>There is no specific format that all articles must follow, but there are a few general tips that can help you structure your article in a way that will make it easier for readers to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by introducing your topic and providing a brief overview of what you will be discussing.</li>
<li>Next, provide more detail about each of your points, using evidence from reliable sources to support your arguments.</li>
