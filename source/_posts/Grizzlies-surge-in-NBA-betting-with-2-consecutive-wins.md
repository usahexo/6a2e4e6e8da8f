#  Grizzlies surge in NBA betting with 2 consecutive wins

The Memphis Grizzlies have surged in NBA betting odds with 2 consecutive wins as they continue to battle for a playoff spot in the Western Conference.

On Sunday, the Grizzlies topped the Houston Rockets 87-78 as 7-point home underdogs. It was their second straight upset victory after knocking off the Oklahoma City Thunder 108-105 on Friday night as 3-point road underdogs.

This has been a terrific run for the Grizzlies, who improved to 8-4 SU and ATS over their past 12 games overall. They are currently in 10th place in the West, 2 games back of the San Antonio Spurs for the final playoff spot.

Memphis is led by Marc Gasol and Mike Conley Jr., who are both averaging over 20 points per game this season. The Grizzlies also have a strong defense that is holding opponents to just 96.8 points per game, which is 5th best in the NBA.

They will look to keep things rolling on Tuesday when they visit the Detroit Pistons as 4-point road underdogs. The Pistons have lost 3 straight and are just 5-13 SU and ATS over their past 18 games overall.

#  Inexperienced Grizzlies struggle with inconsistency, but 2 could lead to improvement

The Memphis Grizzlies started the 2017-2018 NBA season with mixed results. They have beaten quality opponents, such as the Houston Rockets, but they have also lost to teams that many predicted them to beat. Part of this inconsistency may stem from the inexperience of some of their players. Forwards Dillon Brooks and JaMychal Green are both in their second year in the league, and rookie guard Jevon Carter is playing significant minutes.

One bright spot for Memphis has been center Marc Gasol. The Spaniard is averaging a double-double on the season and leads the team in points and rebounds. He has also been shooting well from beyond the arc, which is a new development for him. If Gasol can continue to shoot well from long range, it will make it difficult for opposing defenses to focus exclusively on shutting down Mike Conley and Chandler Parsons.

Conley has also been playing well this season. He is averaging over 20 points per game and leads the team in assists. Parsons, meanwhile, has been inconsistent but showed glimpses of his potential with a 30-point performance against the Dallas Mavericks last week.

The Grizzlies will need continued production from Conley, Gasol, and Parsons if they hope to make the playoffs this season. In order to do so, they will also need improvement from their young players. Brooks and Green have shown flashes of greatness but must become more consistent if Memphis wants to win games against playoff-caliber teams.

Carter has also played well early on in his career. The former West Virginia standout was selected by Memphis with the 32nd overall pick in this year’s draft. He has displayed a great deal of toughness and tenacity on defense, which is something that the Grizzlies have lacked in recent years.

If Brooks, Green, Carter, and the rest of Memphis’s young players can continue to improve, there is no reason why they cannot make a run at the playoffs this season. The Western Conference is wide open after last year’s champions Golden State Warriors lost superstar forward Kevin Durant in free agency. This could be Memphis’s opportunity to return to postseason play for the first time since 2013.

#  Are the Memphis Grizzlies a team to bet on in NBA futures? 

The Memphis Grizzlies have been a team to watch in the NBA for the past few seasons. With some of the top talent in the league, many people are asking if they are worth betting on in future NBA matchups.

The Grizzlies finished last season with a record of 43-39, which was good enough for the seventh seed in the Western Conference playoffs. They were eventually eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in six games. This season, they are looking to make some noise and take down some of the top teams in the conference.

To do this, they will need to rely on their star players: Mike Conley Jr., Marc Gasol, and Zach Randolph. Conley Jr. is coming off an All-Star season where he averaged 20 points per game and led the Grizzlies in assists with 6.1 per game. Gasol is also coming off a strong year, averaging 18.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. Randolph has been with the Grizzlies since they drafted him in 2007 and is still one of their most dangerous players offensively, averaging 17 points and 9 rebounds last season.

These three players are essential to Memphis’ success and are more than capable of taking down any team in the league when playing at their best. With them leading the way, I believe that the Grizzlies are definitely worth betting on in future NBA matchups.

#  Grizzlies stumble out of the gate, but a 2-game winning streak has odds makers taking notice

The Memphis Grizzlies stumbled out of the gate to start the 2018-19 season, losing their first four games. However, they have since won two in a row, including an impressive victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. This has led some to believe that they may be a darkhorse contender in the Western Conference this year.

It is still too early to say for sure, but there is definitely potential for the Grizzlies to make a playoff run. They have one of the best defensive players in the league in Marc Gasol, and are also deep into the bench. Players like JaMychal Green, Garrett Temple and Dillon Brooks provide valuable depth and scoring off of the bench.

Mike Conley is also healthy and back at full strength this season. He averaged 20 points and 6 assists last year and will be looked upon to lead this team offensively. If he can stay healthy and continue playing at a high level, the Grizzlies could certainly make some noise in the playoffs.

It is still unclear who their biggest competition will be in the West this year. The Golden State Warriors are obviously still a powerhouse, but there are several teams that could potentially give them a run for their money. The Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets and Utah Jazz all had strong seasons last year and could pose a challenge to the top teams in the conference.

The Grizzlies will need to continue playing well if they want to compete with these teams. However, with their recent play and the potential of their roster, there is no reason why they can’t make some noise in the playoffs this year.

#  With 2 wins in a row under their belt, the Memphis Grizzlies are starting to look like a good bet

The Memphis Grizzlies have had a rough few years. But it looks like they may be turning the corner. With 2 wins in a row under their belt, they look like a good bet to make the playoffs this year.

The key to their turnaround has been the play of their young stars, including Mike Conley and Marc Gasol. In particular, Gasol has been impressive, averaging over 20 points and 10 rebounds per game.

If they can continue to play well, the Grizzlies should be able to make a run in the playoffs this year.
