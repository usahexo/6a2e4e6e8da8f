#  Baccarat Crystal Showcases Trophy ahead of Soccer World Cups

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) has partnered with Baccarat Crystal to create a one-of-a-kind showcase for the prestigious Jules Rimet Trophy.

This magnificent handcrafted crystal trophy, which will be on display at CBF’s new headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, was designed by world-renowned crystal artist Rainer Merete. The sculpture is composed of 1,001 Baccarat Crystal points, symbolizing the 1,001 goals scored during the history of the World Cup tournament.

The elaborately carved and faceted trophy towers more than two feet high and weighs nearly 30 pounds. It took Merete more than 1,000 hours to create the unique work of art, which is now considered one of the most important pieces in the Baccarat Crystal collection.

CBF President José Maria Marin was visibly moved when he first saw the finished trophy. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime moment for Brazilian football and for our country as we prepare to host the World Cup for a second time,” he said. “Baccarat Crystal has helped us create an incredible tribute to this iconic cup and to all of the players who have helped make it so special.”

At a special ceremony unveiling the trophy, Marin thanked Baccarat Crystal for its support and praised Merete’s incredible skill and artistry. “Rainer’s creation is truly a masterpiece,” he said. “We are grateful to him and to Baccarat Crystal for making it possible. This trophy will be a cherished part of our legacy as we host the biggest event in world sport.”
