<p>At a special ceremony unveiling the trophy, Marin thanked Baccarat Crystal for its support and praised Merete’s incredible skill and artistry. “Rainer’s creation is truly a masterpiece,” he said. “We are grateful to him and to Baccarat Crystal for making it possible. This trophy will be a cherished part of our legacy as we host the biggest event in world sport.”</p>
